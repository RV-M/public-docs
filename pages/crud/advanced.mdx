## Control Visiblity

Select the operation in API tab 

**Invisible** - By default, when enabling APIs, radical generates both the service and controller layers. However, in cases where you specifically require only the service layer, you can utilize the 'invisible' option in such scenarios

**Disable** - This operation is not generated in API

Select the settings icon displayed near the schema for which API has to be modified

## Security

If project level authentication is enabled, authentication can be still controlled at granular API level, 

Use **`Authenticate Route`** option to modify this behaviour

## Control Path of API

By default, pluralized name of schema is used. i.e if schema name is Student then api path would be students, user can change this override to modify the base path

**Note**: To control api level base path, control via settings.
